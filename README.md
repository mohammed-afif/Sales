I have harnessed the power of Power BI to transform raw sales data into actionable insights.

Project Highlights:
Data Source: An extensive sales file featuring key columns such as Product ID, Date, Customer ID, Campaign ID, Units, Product, Category, Segment, Manufacturer ID, Manufacturer, Unit Cost, Unit Price, Zip Code, Email, City, State, Region, District, and Country.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dimension Tables: I Created Dim tables for

 1- Date Table Using M language
 
 2- Product Table
 
 3- Category & Segment Table
 
 4- Customer Table
 
 5- Geography Table
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Modeling: connected dimension tables to the fact table (sales), ensuring accurate relationships and data integrity. Used M language and DAX.

I split the sales table into fact and dimension tables to improve data organization, efficiency, and analysis. Here are the key benefits:

1- Data Organization: Separating data into fact and dimension tables makes the structure cleaner and more manageable.

2- Improved Performance: Queries run faster because dimension tables reduce redundancy and focus on key attributes.

3- Simplified Analysis: Dimension tables allow for easier filtering, grouping, and detailed analysis, enhancing the insights we can derive from the data.

4- Scalability: This structure makes it easier to add new data and dimensions in the future without disrupting the existing system.

Top Region Profit: Texas State of $329.40K

Learnings:
I would have loved to share a live version of this report so you can experience the journey that was created. It was really fun using icons as buttons to filter the data.

I think another important lesson I learned in this project was to keep things simple, there was no need to add a lot of colors, so I don't distract the user. At the same time, create a visually pleasing report that presents important findings for the stakeholders.

Tools : Excel , PowerBi , Dax , M language
